 Bitcoin Miner — Gate-Level Implementation
A gate-level educational prototype of a SHA-256 Bitcoin miner designed in Logisim.
The project demonstrates how digital hashing hardware operates at the fundamental logic-gate level.
Project Overview
This system performs the SHA-256 hashing process used in Bitcoin mining, constructed primarily from 2-input logic gates and essential structural blocks (multiplexers, registers, flip-flops, etc.).
While the muxes and registers are used as standard Logisim components for simplicity, they represent circuits that are easily buildable using NAND, NOR, and other basic gates — meaning the design still qualifies as gate-level logic in concept.
 Technical Summary
Specification
Details
Design Level
Gate-Level (with standard MUX/Register blocks)
Technology Used
Logisim (Digital Circuit Simulator)
Total 2-Input Logic Gates
≈ 50,000 – 60,000
Clock Cycles per Hash
≈ 500 – 600
Optimization Potential
Can be reduced using pipelined buffers between A, B, C,… calculations
 Logisim does not allow fine-grained pipelining or buffering between intermediate SHA-256 stages.
In a hardware description language (HDL) or FPGA, clock cycles can be greatly reduced by inserting registers at key stages.
Gate-Level Note
Although the internal structures of MUXes and registers are not manually drawn gate-by-gate in this project,
they are conceptually simple and can be recreated using:
MUX → 3 × 2-input gates per bit (Y = (A & ¬S) | (B & S))
D-Flip-Flop / Register → built from NAND/NOR latches (≈ 8 gates per bit)
This means that the entire miner could be expanded into fully discrete gate-level form if desired.
